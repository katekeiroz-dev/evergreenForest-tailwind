### ✴️ ABOUT THE PROJECT <br>
This is a personal project, where I created a landing page related to a tourism business.
Also created with responsiveness for smaller screens like mobile.


### PROJECT MAIN GOAL  <br>

- The objective of the project was to apply knowledge about the Tailwind CSS framework in practice.

### Stacks used   <br>
- HTML5
- CSS(tailwind)
- javascript

  
### Knowledges adquired <br>
- Tailwind Fundamentals (Box Model, Arbitrary Values, Grid, Flex, Align and Justify, Display, Position etc)
- Modifiers (Pseudo Classes, Before, After, Responsiveness)
- Customization (Settings, Reusing Styles and Adding Styles)
- Creation of plugins to add properties/styles that don't exist in Tailwind
- Reusable styles, by using the layer components  and @apply (allows you to add Tailwind classes directly to CSS selectors)

### Advantages of using TAILWIND  <br>
- No need to switch between files
- Constrains styling consistently
- Makes it easy to see element styling
- Optimized for production
- Tailwind has less verbosity, helps maintain consistency and most importantly allows the use of modifiers,
  something you can't get with Inline CSS
